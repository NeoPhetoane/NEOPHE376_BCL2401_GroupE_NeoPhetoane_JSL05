**Overview**
This project was to create a function that generates playlists for characters from "Guardians of the Galaxy" based on their preferred music genre. The function uses an array of song objects and an object containing each Guardian's genre preference to filter and organise songs into individual playlists.

**Reflections**

**Areas of Mastery**
Data Structures: This project enhanced my understanding of manipulating arrays and objects. Using methods like map and filter, I was able to create a playlist for each Guardian effectively.

Referencing CSS: I was able apply the CSS classes to the content using classList.add.

Declarative Approach: The function I created demonstrates a high-level representation of the playlist generation process, focusing on defining "what" needs to be done rather than detailing the specific "how" at each step.

**Challenges Faced**
Arrays: At first, I struggled with creating an array and then calling it. It was an object that was called as if it was an array and would still work but created errors when CSS had to be implemented.

Appending: At the beginning of this project, I was unsure what appending really meant and my content would not show when run. I realised that it is the property that allows the content in that function to show when run.

**Areas for Improvement**
Function readability: The function is a short version that seems easy to read but is actually clustered with mounds of information per function.

Usability: The site does not allow adding of songs. Only the person with access to the code can add to the list.

**Overall Learning Experience**

Creating the playlist generator function provided me with valuable practice in abstract thinking, data structure manipulation, and problem-solving. It made me realise that more practice was necessary on my end with creating effective arrays and how to call them.
